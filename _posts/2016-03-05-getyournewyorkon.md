# \#GetYourNewYorkOn

I think endurance is a state of mind. Sure physical fitness
is needed and you can train for it but first of all you need the right mindset.

Since I was a child I could always out-run, bike or swim any
of my friends. I was never the fastest but I could go on forever.

Unfortunately, in my school those skills did not count and I
never made it to the rank of the athletes. One time, I was in 6th grade, even
my swim teacher forgot about me in the pool and I swam for 90 min instead of
20\. While she was upset about herself and apologetic, I really did not care,
the time had passed by and while I was swimming I had done all my homework in
my head.

Whereas growing older running helped me to clear my mind and
stay focused.

It also helped through a difficult divorce. By then I did
not have fancy gadgets to measure my runs and I had no idea what I did while running
for 2 hours through Bordeaux or Paris France.

In 2000 the annual marathon of Bordeaux took place and the
city closed down, I watched all the runners tracing by my house, I had seen
some of them training earlier on that week and they seemed to just ride on
effortlessly. It was beautiful to watch. I later read that it is one of the
most difficult exercises for the brain to coordinate the human body movements
and get it to run. Watch a slow motion picture on TV on runners trying to
sprint at the Olympics and you can see how coordinate the body has to be to get
the best out of the athlete.

After Bordeaux, I was very impressed and thought that I
would never be able to do a marathon but still continued to run.

When I moved back to Paris, I used to run on Fridays and
Saturdays through the city for 2 to 3 hours at a nice pace, never knowing the
distance I covered and never really looking for it.

Then I moved to the US and discovered charity races. They
seemed to be so appealing because I could do what I like and support a cause
that was worthy to me.

So I ran for breast cancer because of my mom.

It took a lot to adapt to my new country and for a while I
stopped and got out of shape. 4 years ago I got a wake up call. One morning I
looked into the mirror and decided that the couching had to stop and that I
needed to get back in shape.

My memories about running did not come with much effort or
pain but it was hard to get back into it. I started with running around the
block, the preserve, the first 5K, the first 10K and little by little it became
fun again. I have to say what helped a lot was the little gadget that you now
can wear around your arm and that cheers you on, gives you music and that
tracks all your movements on a website where you can earn badges, medals and so
on. The other encouragement is that I am married to my biggest supporter,
whether it is getting up at 6 and getting me to the starting line or waiting
for 2 hours until I cross the finish line, I know that my husband will be
there.

While I got back in shape running became again an integral
part of me, it helps me with organizing my work, go through rough patches,
prepare for presentations, find inspiration.

When I am on the road (and it can be 107 degrees outside
here in Texas) I feel free and happy.

At the same time I feel that I belong to a group, the group
of runners, dasher ...the 5ker's the 10K'ers and the half marathoner's and
hopefully soon to the 26.2 sticker family and especially the one's who ran New
York.

While training for various races, every time I get to the
start line, I feel the same wave of friendly faces, I feel that we are all the
same, we want to own that road and conquer it and it does not matter who is the
fastest as long as we all cross the finish line.

In October 2014 I ran my first half in San Francisco, while
the training was fun and I met a lot of fellow runners, first virtually and
then in person I remember all the impressions I took in from beautiful San
Fran, the hills, the people cheering on, the Botanical garden in the fog, the
bridge -- a unique view of the city, my view of the city.

Every runner I met either did NY or wants to do NY. NY is a
mythical place for runners. See the city that never sleeps, where everybody
rushes and pushes through at your own pace. Something unique, an experience
that will be different and memorable for every one of the 50000 dashers waiting
at the starting line this year on November 1st 2015\.

While training is hard and fellow runners who did it will
tell you about hitting the wall, the hill at mile 24 and that maybe they had
been ready to give up but they pushed through because their minds had been set.
The mind is the key; it will push the trained body through the tough last
miles.

Training is hard, between work, running early to avoid the 3
digit temperatures and the reward is about 90 days out, crossing that finish
line and earning the right to wear a finisher shirt.

There will be a long wait before we start of off. I will
have to keep my mind on focus so that when New York New York plays for me and
my feet start to run towards the first bridge I will fully be there and ready
to take the challenge so that I can get my impression of the mystical course
through the 5 boroughs.

And it will all be so worth it. And it was so worth it!
