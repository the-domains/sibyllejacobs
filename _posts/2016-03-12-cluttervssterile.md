# \#ClutterVsSTerile

A recent Berkeley Study looked intimately in middle class households and focused on belongings and household organization.

Actually never before has mankind owned so many things.

From clothing, to shoes to collectibles, toys and all other kinds of items, we literally drown in it and most of the time we cannot oversee what we actually possess.

We need storage in our houses, we need storage boxes, storage units to own and put away items.

Some of them we will never touch again.

It might be interesting to see what archaeologist might conclude in a couple of centuries when they excavate our dwellings.

While we amass all these items our houses need to look less and less inhabited.

Kitchens all over the world need granite counter tops to expose some fancy knick-knacks. Kitchens on TV always look like the cleaning crew just swiped through and you wonder if there is some actual cooking ever going to happen. Nothing to do with the less optimized kitchens of our grandmothers, where things were not perfect but where we cooked together and decided humanities fate.

Then comes the living room, pillows and throws neatly organized, will we ever sit down anywhere?

Where do we actually live, in the sanctuary bathroom where monogrammed towels are hung up as in hotel rooms.

Same with children's rooms, mine was always a mess and I was constantly constructing something or redefining the usage of various objects. Now children rooms are like museums, toys are on shelves and look like nobody touches them, they are just exposed.

To whom do we demonstrate these museum rooms? Why?

Where do we actually live? Living means to brush things around and to make a mess.

I am not saying we should not clean up but sterile rooms don't say much about living.

So on one hand we collect, collect, collect until we have to rent a second house to store. What are we doing with all these possessions and most of them cost 10 cents and re made in China. On the other hand we show neatly organized living spaces -- and all around the world those look the same.

Where is our sanctuary where we actually can be ourselves and expose our private mess to ourselves and to others?

When was the last time we had chaos in our house, friendly chaos, where we came together as a group, prepared a dish and ate while discussing the news and did not care whether the kitchen was up to Martha Stewarts standards?
