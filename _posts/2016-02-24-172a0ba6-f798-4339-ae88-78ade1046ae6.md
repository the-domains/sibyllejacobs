A morning run only makes sense if the training effect is optimized, so the App for nocturnal breathing control has determined the ideal time for me to get up.

**5:15 AM**

Connected to my alarm clock with daylight simulator in an individual color spectrum, the wake time calculated for me will also optimize my vitamin D production.  
The fact that my head aches as if somebody had a hatchet in it, must be my fault. **Apps are never wrong.**

Glancing at the heart rate monitor app build into my pajamas, two strokes over normal resting pulse, medium red alarm signals,  
**What does it mean?**

* Signs of an oncoming cold?
* Vitamins missing?
* Allergies?

I need the "Analyze my saliva app", if only the smartphone would fit better under my tongue.  
My compression stockings itch but they are designed to speed up the nightly regeneration.  
On the way to my bathroom I turn off the fan, which constantly keeps the air pressure in my bedroom as if I was  2500 meters above sea level. Ideal for athletes engaged in endurance training.  
PH gauges in the center beam: 0.3 percent below the optimum base value.  
**Another sign of alarm?**

The Power Breakfast App found the perfect ingredients for the performance-enhancing morning smoothie:

* Parsley & leek hearts from Sonoma Valley -- organic
* Ginger from Costa Rica
* Rare algae from Western Finland
* All lactose free

The family wakes up from the howling of the blender, but the morning atmosphere is still optimized.

Smoothie tastes like a wet cocker spaniel.

The Quality Time App proposes educationally valuable discussion topics for gifted children, including fun tasks for optimal brain development.

The children breathe shallowly when I approach them.  
The smoothie not only tastes like wet Cocker Spaniel, but apparently also leaves the morning breath smell accordingly.  
Good thing the tough mornings with tough children app also provides child empathy expansion.

For Steve a good morning kiss is recommended as well as the question: " Did you sleep well , my darling ? " With polished teeth this loving dialogue brings three bonus points on the marriage stabilization scale. Our communication is optimized for warmth ; thank you happy marriage app.**Had a Groupon for that one.**

The Motivation App has put together the optimal playlist for me considering quality of sleep, wake up time, weather and general well feeling.

Actually, I could start running now but the perfect equipment has to be selected.

The equipment App gives me four textile options, if the temperature is strong, weak or non- increasing and the rain gets stronger. Better even to wait and see how the weather is.

The Weather app reports light rain, a soil temperature of 34 degrees and determines the ideal shoes. The infra-red running shoe profile tester reports that it would be the Solarlon 6A but only 217 miles are allowed on those and 215 have been consumed already.  
Good thing the RUNNING PRO APP suggests the individually adapted Carbon/Silicon inlays. This allows 30 more miles on the shoes.

GPS data of my running routes is calculated and streaming to an online database.

The training plan program app has put together the optimum training sequence of my morning run. All values ​​are automatically posted to Facebook & Twitter. The build in photo app is sequenced to take images every 5 min and pin them to my profile.

Other runners will be able to comment on my posture and suggest cross-training plans.

**And off I go.**

I push the smartphone into the armband, the motivational app plays the perfect playlist while the oxygen app sets the perfect rhythm for breathing.  
The Runfriend App matches me with other running partners who are out there running at this moment in their optimal workout clothes.

Last week I had an online running partner from Argentina. We heard each other breathing through earpieces while we were hitting the pavement.  
Afterwards we shared our playlists online and compared our current pulse values ​​.**Beautiful!**Running does create new friendships.

The quote app blinks for the encouragement of the day:

Transform bad thoughts into positive thinking.

After the 11.58 mile run, optimal length at optimal time and weather the coach app in synch with the comments pinned to my pictures suggest 17 pushups and a lymphatic massage in the right ankle, which I take over my online controlled massage chair. Great program, but only two "Likes" in 15 minutes. I will ask my husband to share my posts.  
I need an app to increase the likes, sending a note to myself with the don't forget app for later research.  
I am trying first pushups on my special mat. The laser emitter in the wall controls the optimal design. The blue light warns again against technical weaknesses, not with my equipment,**but with me.**  
At the same time, the sensors report lack of salt. Morning sweat from the workout, which could potentially increase my risk of a seizure by 7.2 percent. Immediately the alarm app advises to cancel the cross training. A warning appears that the app company is not responsible if any damages occur. As we can guess, lawyers have participated in the app's development.

The Coach app plays sad music for failed cross training, while the motivational app makes proposals to transform the bad conscience in positive thinking.

Technical possibilities -- how did we organize ourselves and stayed fit without them?
