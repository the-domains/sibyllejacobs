Although I had read through the great tips and advice from confirmed marathoners, I could not apply most of it. First I could not really sleep in my hotel, just can’t sleep in a bed that is not mine. Food was not what it should have been and on Saturday I was so nervous that I skipped dinner, could not get a bite down even if I wanted to.</p><p>I woke up at 6, my gear was ready and after a hot shower I put my clothes on, grabbed my clear bag and hit the street. My husband signaled a cab and we made it to the staten island ferry. This is where he had to say good bye and I was suddenly on my own with a whole different entourage. I heard a lot of Italian, saw runners with flags painted on their cheeks and there were the experienced ones walking calmly to the Ferry and the rookies trying to keep calm.</p><p>Dogs had to sniff our bags so we could get on the boat. I went to the top floor and sat outside. Gentle winds, clement temperatures, a great promising day. The ferry took off and as we were drifting towards staten island we could see the statue of liberty smiling down on us, the crazy bunch of runners, ready to conquer the streets of New York.Once we got off the ferry we had to stay in line to get on our bus to take us to the start village. At that point I was hungry with an upset stomach not knowing what to do. During the bus ride I helped a Japanese runner who was a little lost and we walked together to the orange village. I wanted a banana but only got a power bar that I ate with 2 cups of dunking donuts coffee. Then a wave one runner gave me his pizza box and blanket so I could sit on the ground and wait for wave 4 to be called.</p><p>Time passed quickly and I had to say good bye to my warm pants and fleece shirt. While I was walking up to coral A I also had to say goodbye to my clear bag. It seemed to hold all my belongings and it was emotionally difficult to toss it.<br>Coral orange wave 4A was walking to the start. Here we were, a bunch of crazy runners determined to make it through. The boss was singing … born to run …and then the Marines got off the road which was the official sign that the start was imminent. NYPD was in the air, we sang the National Anthem and gun shot.</p><p>The biggest incline on our 26 miles was in front of us, the Verrazano Bridge. It is very fortunate that this course is not the other way round, I would not have been able to make this incline at mile 26.</p><p>Off we go, beautiful views on New York and once we hit the decline Brooklyn is in front of us. Bands are playing, people are cheering everywhere, it looks like that every New Yorker is on the street to see us, to get us going.</p><p>One thing is sure, without these spectators, I would not have made it. I was running at a nice pace 10:22 and I was calculating my fueling and water intake. So at mile 8 I started to take 3 blockshots and 2 cups of water.<br>Every 3 to 5 miles I refueled. My stomach started to feel really bad at mile 15 – bathroom stop taking out 20 minutes of my time. Queensborough bridge was mile 16 and that is where my family was standing and cheering and clapping for me.</p><p>My adrenaline went up and all of a sudden my stomach ache was gone and I was feeling great. Mile 20 – Willis Bridge – I walked up the bridge and then started to run again. A fellow runner and I had a short conversation about some of the funny signs we were seeing and then we hit 5th avenue guiding us into Central Park. I walked mile 24 uphill and then I ran full pace 12:08 into the finish line.</p><p>5:28:28 official time, tears running down my face when I got my medal and the poncho.</p><p>Pain, pain, pain but you have to keep moving.</p><p>this was an amazing race, an amazing experience and every drop of sweat from my training was worth it.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="50"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="52"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="53"><span data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><h2 data-reactid="56"><a data-reactid="57">SibylleJacobs</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="60"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="61"></div></section></div></div>

Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.","foundry":"google","family":"Oswald","name":"Oswald","normal":3,"bold":3},"screen":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$caps":"normal","foundry":"google","family":"Roboto","name":"Roboto","license":"apache","tags":["sans serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google. Despite being accused of being a “frankenfont” mashup of DIN and Helvetica, I’m personally quite fond of Roboto. I think it renders crisply on screens and is very legible, even at smaller sizes.
